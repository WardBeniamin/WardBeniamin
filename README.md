## 👋 Hi, I'm Ward Beniamin

I’m a .NET developer with a strong focus on backend development, REST APIs, and clean architecture.
I enjoy building structured, maintainable, and scalable applications using C#, ASP.NET Core,
Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server.

I’m passionate about problem-solving, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into
well-architected software solutions. I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can
grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects in professional teams 🚀

## 🌐 Portfolio & Design

Alongside my backend projects, I also work with design and presentation to clearly communicate
ideas, structure, and system thinking.

This site represents my personal branding and how I present projects, architecture,
and development concepts in a clear and structured way.
