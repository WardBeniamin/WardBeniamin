## 💫 About Me

I am a .NET developer with a strong focus on backend development, REST APIs, and clean architecture.
I enjoy building structured, maintainable, and scalable applications using C#, ASP.NET Core,
Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server.

I am passionate about learning new technologies, improving my technical skills,
and solving real-world problems through well-structured software solutions.
Currently, I am looking for opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and gain
hands-on experience in professional development teams. 🚀
