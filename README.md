## 💫 About Me

I am a .NET system development student with a strong interest in backend development,
REST APIs, and clean architecture. I enjoy building structured, maintainable, and scalable
applications using C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server.

I am currently focused on developing my skills through hands-on projects and am actively
seeking an LIA (internship) where I can contribute to real-world software solutions and grow
as a backend-focused .NET developer.
